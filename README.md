# APIAcceptanceTests-Specflow-Nunit
This is a demo project to prove how API acceptance tests can be written in C# with Nunit framework and as well as with Specflow.

It also contains basic UI automation framework written in C# / Nunit (Pageobject based pattern)
It also contains my initial exploration with Protractor JS-End to End testing framework
